//Scenario
/*
For this activity, suppose you are creating a basic login feature for a banking app. You will use tuples to store the credentials for logging into the banking app.
*/

//1: Store the app credentials in tuple:
let credentials = ("", -1111)

//2: Evaluate credentials
if credentials.0 == "" || credentials.1 < 0 {
  print("Invalid credentials!")
} else {
  print("The username is \(credentials.0) and the password is \(credentials.1).")
}

//3: Store the appâ€™s full credentials
let fullCredentials = (password: "pass", passcode: 1111)

//4: Revaluate credentials:
if fullCredentials.password == "" || fullCredentials.passcode < 0 {
  print("Invalid credentials!")
} else {
  print("The password is \(fullCredentials.password) and the passcode is \(fullCredentials.passcode).")
}
